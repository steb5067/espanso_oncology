# espanso_oncology

## initial work on an espanso set of forms
* based on https://espanso.org/
* aim is to improve the basic data captured
* intent is to be concise: 
  + as little boiler plate as will do the job
  + in the tradition of oxford neurology: the entire letter is one foolscap page, more wont be read

## common tasks being targeted
* routine followup of patients on surveillance
* routine treatment reviews

## naming convention
* task::situation
* tasks:
  + rev = review
  + fup = follow up
* situations:
  + io = immunotherapy
  + crt = H&N chemoradiotherapy
  + gbmn = nano criteria for brain cancer
* examples:
  + fupgbmn = follow up gbm using nano 
  + revio = review on immunotherapy

## eventually
