# espanso_oncology

## initial work on an espanso set of forms
* based on https://espanso.org/
* aim is to improve the basic data captured
* intent is to be concise: as little boiler plate as will do the job
* in the tradition of oxford neurology: the entire letter is one foolscap page, more wont be read


## common tasks being targetted
* routine followup of patients on surveillance
* routine treatment reviews


## eventually
* cover most common clinical scenarios I encounter
* maybe not initial consultations
